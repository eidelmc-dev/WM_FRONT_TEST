Home Page Weding Match Test

Overview
The goal of this test is to evaluate the developer's ability to build a landing page based on provided mockups. The developer will be given access to the mockups and required assets, and they will be expected to create a responsive landing page using React.



Requirements
Design Implementation: The developer should accurately translate the design elements from the mockups into HTML and CSS.

Responsiveness: The landing page should be responsive and display correctly on various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Assets: Use provided images and icons (if any) to match the mockups.

Evaluation Criteria
Accuracy: How closely the final landing page matches the provided mockups.
Responsiveness: How well the landing page adapts to different screen sizes.
Code Quality: The cleanliness, organization, and readability of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Submission
The developer should submit the completed landing page source code along with any necessary instructions or documentation. The submission can be made via a GitHub repository or as a compressed file containing the project files.


Feedback and Discussion
After reviewing the submission, we will schedule a meeting to provide feedback on the developer's work and discuss any areas for improvement.
